GHUpdate
========

The sports club I'm in has a website.  However, the committee often has
no techy members available to update it.

This will allow non-techy users to update their GitHub pages with a nice WYSIWYG editor without exposing any html or git commands.

It is inspired by [CushyCMS][1] - I just didn't want the hassle of self-managed
hosting and FTP passwords anymore.  Also, git's history is very reassuring.

Goals
-----

 - Non technical user can easily select the repo corresponding to their website
 - Editable pages are clearly accessible, other repo files are not distracting
 - Very easy to adjust text, add web/mailto links, adjust tables
 - Allow pdf upload / picture embedding
 - Serve over HTTPS (maybe free [Heroku piggybacking][2])
